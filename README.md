# FAST: Distributed Systems & Parallel Computing Labs ðŸš€  

Welcome to **FAST**, a repository that captures my journey through the labs of **MIT 6.5840 (Distributed Systems)** and **Stanford CS 149 (Parallel Computing)**.  

This is more than just codeâ€”it's a personal mission to master the *language of distributed systems and computation*. Each lab is accompanied by a detailed write-up where I explain my approaches, decisions, and perspectives. My goal is to learn and teach as i go , so not everything here is correct !   

If youâ€™re passionate about distributed systems, parallel computing, or both, I hope this repository offers value and sparks meaningful discussions!
