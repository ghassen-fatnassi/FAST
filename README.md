# FAST: Advanced OOP, Distributed Systems & Parallel Computing Labs ðŸš€  

## ðŸ“‹ Intro 

Welcome to **FAST**, a repository that captures my journey through the labs of:
**Stanford CS 249A (Object-Oriented Programming from a Modeling and Simulation Perspective )**
**MIT 6.5840 (Distributed Systems)**
**Stanford CS 149 (Parallel Computing)**.  

This is more than just code, it's a personal mission to master the *language of distributed systems and computation*. Each lab is accompanied by a detailed write-up where I explain my approaches, decisions, and perspectives. My goal is to learn and teach as i go , so not everything here is correct, feel free to critique!
